# Minikube Cluster Creation

This module may be used to create a Minikube Cluster that may be used for running a Theia Cloud Getting Started application.

We expect that users are already familiar with Minikube and that Minikube is installed along with with the required driver and transient dependencies of the driver. We use Virtualbox as the default driver.

The module will create a single node cluster and connects `kubectl` with the Minikube cluster.
