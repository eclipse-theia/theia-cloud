# Keycloak Realm Setup

We are using oauth2-proxy as reverse proxy. The official setup instructions to use the Keycloak OIDC Auth Provider with oauth2-proxy can be found here: https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/configuration/oauth_provider/#keycloak-oidc-auth-provider

The main difference is that our client is not confidential but public, since we are also initiating the login process via the keycloak js library, which requests a public client.

* Switch to the new Realm and create a new client with
  * client id: "theia-cloud"
