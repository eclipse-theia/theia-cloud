# Monitor

VSCode extension to monitor Theia.cloud hosted VSCode/Theia products.
The extension will expose a rest service, where an external service can ping the extension to get information about the pod.

The extension is designed to facilitate the addition of further modules in the future.

For this, the extension reads environment variables to check the activation of each corresponding module.

For an example on setting these environment variables, take a look at the `Run extension` launch config in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

```json
"THEIACLOUD_MONITOR_PORT": "8081",
"THEIACLOUD_MONITOR_ENABLE_ACTIVITY_TRACKER": "true"
```
