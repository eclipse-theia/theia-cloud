# service Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/> .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_** Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Debug the service

When you have the service running in dev mode you can use the `Attach to Service` debug config to debug the service.

Check the [OpenAPI documentation](../../../documentation/OpenAPI.md) to see how you can send requests to the service.

_Note_: The landing page will not communicate with this service, as it will be hosted on another address.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.

## Provided Code

## Unit tests

Unit tests use the Quarkus test infrastructure.

All tests can be run in Eclipse via launch config [TheiaCloud Service Tests](./TheiaCloud Service Tests.launch).

When running tests from an IDE, the following VM argument might need to be set to enable logging during tests (this is pre-configured in the launch config):

```bash
-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager
```

See [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#test-from-ide) for more information.

### Conventions

For unit test naming, we use the naming pattern `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`, e.g. `authenticate_anonymousUser_throwForbidden`.
